The decision classifier model helps us predict churn by learning patterns in these selected features. Hereâ€™s what we learned:

Customer Service Calls is the Strongest Predictor:

The more frequently a customer contacts customer service, the higher the likelihood of churn. This suggests that resolving customer complaints efficiently could reduce churn. Customers with an International Plan are at Higher Risk:

These customers may be dissatisfied with the cost or quality of the international calling plan. Improving this service could improve retention. Voice Mail Plan is Predictive:

While less obvious, whether a customer has a voicemail plan or not may relate to overall service usage or satisfaction. This could be worth exploring further. Total International Calls Adds Context:

Customers making frequent international calls may represent a specific customer segment. Understanding their unique needs (e.g., better international rates or service quality) could reduce churn.
